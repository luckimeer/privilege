                    <h1>What does this mean.</h1>
                    <h3>Having privilege <i><u>does not</u></i> mean you are a bad person. Everyone has certain privileges. However, actively ignoring, denying, or rejecting your privilege makes you complicit in discrimination and injustice. This complicity prevents you from recognizing the raw realities that exist for people who disproportionately experience hate bias and discrimination. I urge you to learn how to use your privilege towards social justice. Acknowledging your innate privilege opens the door for vulnerability. This may make you feel uncomfortable; you may make missteps. I challenge you to confront this uncomfortable feeling - why it makes you uncomfortable, why are you so unsettled right now, how can this help others. These are slight, but mighty steps you can take to recognize your privilege and grow in your advocacy for what is just.
                    <br><br>
                    Consider what being an ally means to you. Be more than an ally - <u><b>BECOME AN ACTIVE ADVOCATE</b></u> for the community.
